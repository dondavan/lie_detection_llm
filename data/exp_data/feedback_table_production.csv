When trying to convince the AI that a truthful statement was deceptive, I removed details and tried to sound more unsure of myself using language like ""I think"" and ""probably"", so that the statement seemed less credible.","This survey took way longer than anticipated. The last statement that I had to rewrite was particularly difficult, as no matter how many details I added, the AI kept reading my statement as deceptive. I was honestly exhausted by the end of it. I suggest offering a higher compensation for participants because this study requires lots of effort."

9,646dc9848e53ff1705d8c9c5,10.0,10.0,"To flip from deceptive to truthful seemed rather simple, as I simply re-organised and re-worded certain elements of each text in order to make it seem more sensible.  

However, tasks which required me to flip the AI's from an impression that the statement was truthful to deceptive proved far more difficult––and most of my attempts to do so actually failed quite miserably. 
","I encountered a number of technical issues along the way which used up many hours of my day––thus making the task seem even more difficult (and enormously frustrating). 

Many of these issues were reported via Prolific messaging, so I shall paste a few highlights into this box for your consideration: 

Firstly, I would attempt to submit text and be sent back to the same point––with no evidence showing of any submission (1/5  or 1/10 being a constant on the screen for several turns). 
Most of the time no error message appeared to indicate why my submissions were rejected on previous occasions, though on a couple of occasions I encountered the following: 

""Please write a statement before submitting.""

I had written a statement on each occasion, despite the system's apparent inclination to indicate otherwise. This felt incredibly frustrating, as I had no idea as to why this keeps happening. 
In the end I suppose that's part of why my submissions had not always been registering with the counter, though at times I would submit something and be sent back without an error appearing.  

Additionally, on several occasions my entries would simply disappear unexpectedly due to some seemingly random reloading which seemed to occur within the model whilst I was typing. As such, I was forced to begin typing the same statement over and again––which, again, was massively frustrating.   

Furthermore, the latter issue appears to be happening now in THIS VERY BOX as I type, so I’m having to go back and copy everything as I write more and more (so that it won’t disappear before I finish).
