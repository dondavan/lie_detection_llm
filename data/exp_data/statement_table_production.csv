. He’s still pretty young and completely obsessed with Disney and he watches the movies all the time. So we decided to surprise him with a trip to Disney World. We don’t live too far, so it made sense as a birthday getaway. He had no idea we were planning it, and when we told him, his face just lit up. It was one of those moments you don’t forget. He’s a huge fan of Dumbo and Bambi, and seeing the park in real life after only knowing it from pictures was such a big deal for him.

Despite the benefits, I felt like I was losing myself in the process. I made a difference for the company, but my individuality suffered. The ping-pong games and camaraderie with colleagues were nice, but they weren't enough to compensate for the lack of fulfillment.

The first night we ate dinner at a Japanese restaurant. Breakfast was prepared all mornings we were there. The other nights, we had Chinese and also ate in Savannah, GA. For fun, we went to a plantation and traveled to other cities, like Charleston and Savannah, GA.

We had breakfast at the inn in SC each morning, then travelled further afield––often away from South Carolina––for dinner on subsequent evenings. As the Japanese populace is known for longevity, our first dining excursion was Japanese. China is known for vibrant festival food, so we were sure to include a Chinese experience. On subsequent evenings we drove to Savannah, GA. We also visited a plantation and ventured to nearby cities Charleston and Savannah.

One day, my friend  drank and drank until he could not walk anymore, and decided to drive his car back home. He drank and drank until his stomach exploded. I could not believe my eyes.
Unfortunately, my dear friend did not listen to anyone. He went to catch fish and he was drinking again. One night, I got a phone call from him that he had driven his car in a ditch and he needed someone to pick him up because he could not get it out.. From that day, my friend promised he will never drink apple juice again because look what happened. ",0,61.2567,2025-05-22 14:35:29,2025-05-22 14:46:31

On top of everything they wanted to do it outdoors which is fine usually but with where we live and what time of year it was which was March proved to be a little challenging. But it was a task I was up for doing for a couple of friends.

It was technically the first wedding I covered alone, and honestly, I wasn’t even sure I was fully prepared. They had this idea to hold it outdoors, which might’ve been fine if it weren’t March and freezing cold where we live. I remember waking up that day and thinking the weather might ruin everything, since it was barely 10 degrees and didn’t warm up much. Still, I agreed to do it and tried to make the best of it, especially for them. The location ended up being behind someone’s house—possibly a relative’s—somewhere with trees and shade, which felt odd given the cold. Despite everything, it sort of worked out, though I’m not sure they got exactly what they’d pictured.

Their laughter instead of stepping in made me feel embarrassed and unprotected. Those moments stuck with me and shaped some of my earliest feelings about being supported by adults. Now, looking back as an adult, I can see he wasn’t trying to hurt me. He just loved making jokes and playing harmless pranks. What felt like bullying then now feels more like misunderstanding. It’s interesting how perspective changes things as you grow older.",0,61.3183,2025-05-22 15:42:28,2025-05-22 15:43:43

One person in particular was someone who really loved to play jokes on people and tease them. I have so many memories of them in particular picking on me. It really resented with me as a child because it was always in the presence of teachers and instead of doing anything about it, they laughed at him. It was some really early memories that I have of not feeling protected. As an adult, I know now that he was just a jokester and someone who loved pranks and joking around but as a kid, I saw it as torment and a bully.",0,53.0618,"This experience had a lasting effect on me, especially because some of the visitors hadn’t seen me since I was a child. One person in particular stood out, a family member who was known for his constant joking and playful teasing. As a kid, I often felt singled out by him, especially when he made jokes in front of my teachers. Their laughter made me feel exposed and left out, like no one was standing up for me. Those moments stuck with me and contributed to some of my earliest memories of feeling vulnerable. Over time, I’ve come to see things differently. Now, I realize he didn’t mean any harm, he just enjoyed making people laugh. What felt overwhelming to me back then now seems more like innocent fun, misunderstood through a child’s eyes.
